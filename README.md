This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Our idea for this project came from the fact we are interested in designing some sort of app to help people
with their mental and physical health.

First, make a new account by signing up. Once you signed up, you can see on the left your name, age, and location. 
You will also see a manager button for habits, goals, and accomplishments. You can create a habit like running 
or reading or sleeping and categorize it like exercise or self-help.

Next, you can select a goal for each by choosing how many minutes you want to spend on it per week. 
The accomplishment manager will track how much you have spent on your habit so far during the week 
as a percentage. You can also see the previous week's accomplishments. The doughnut graph in the 
center shows each goal accomplished for each day of the week. Each week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday.
