# How we got our idea
Our idea for this project came from the fact we are interested in designing some sort of app to help people
with their mental and physical health. First, we wanted to have a graph in our project and we all had an interest
in human health. After discussing ideas like Garmin and FitBit, we settled on the idea to make an app similar to 
those apps. 

## Technologies
* React
* Ruby version: 2.6.1
* Rails API backend

# Instructions
To run the app, follow these instructions: 
1. $ cd /frontend-fit-task-ic
2. $ npm install
3. $ npm start
Now you should see the signup/login page. 

# Overview on how to use
First, make a new account by signing up. Once you signed up, you can see on the left your name, age, and location.
This is exactly the same for those who already have an account and logged in. You will also see a manager button for habits, 
goals, and accomplishments. 

# Habit
Click on "Habit Manager". You can see, create or edit an existing habit like running or reading or sleeping and
categorize it like exercise or self-help in the activity type box. 

# Goal
Next, let's talk about the "Goal Manager" button. Here, you can see your current, create, edit, or delete your goals.
To do so, type in the duration in minutes, frequency per week, and select your habit. Once done, click "submit" and it should
show up in accomplishments.

# Accomplishment
The "Accomplishment Manager" will track how much you have spent on your habits so far during the week 
as a percentage. Click on the "Accomplishment Manager" button and a menu box will show up in the center.
You can click progress or add a new accomplishment. When you want to add a new accomplishment, select the date, the goal 
and duration. Once that is donw, the weekly graph should fill up. You can also see the previous week's accomplishments. 
The doughnut graph in the center shows each goal accomplished for each day of the week. Each week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday. 

# Acknowledgements
We wish to thank to our instructor and coach for helping us get through some of the issues that we struggled to find a solution to.
